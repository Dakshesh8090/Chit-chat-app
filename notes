this is a notes file yha hum samhte jayenge terms used in the project

👉 Web Socket - webscoket ek two way communication protocal hai
               - It's a permanent connection between your browser (client) and the server
               - Both can send messages to each other anytime

               🔁 In contrast:
               HTTP = You knock on the door (send request), get a reply, and leave (one-way)
               WebSocket = You stay connected and keep talking freely (two-way)


👉 Stomp       - it is known as Simple text oriented messaging protocol
               -  It's a messaging format used on top of WebSocket
               - It lets you send and receive messages from specific topics or destinations



👉 Message Broker    - just like a postman is acts as a middle man between the receiver and sender
                     Imagine:
                     -You write a letter 📩 to your friend
                     You drop it in a post box 📮
                     The post office 🏤 takes care of delivering it to your friend
                     You don't directly hand it to them — that’s the job of the post office.

                     ✅ In tech, a message broker works the same way:
                     It receives messages from one part of your app (called producer)
                     It delivers them to another part (called consumer)

                       In WebSocket + STOMP Context:
                      When you use WebSocket with STOMP in Spring Boot:

                      The message broker handles routing of messages to different destinations (topics/queues)

                      💡 Example:
                      You send a message to /app/chat.send, and the message broker:

                      Takes it

                      Delivers it to /topic/public where all users are subscribed

                      in short client se message lekar ye he server kai pass jata hai



👉withSockJs        - biht sare browsers may be support na kre web socket for communication
                      toh wha pr ye help krta hai


👉  .addEndPoint("/ws)   -Toh /ws ye batata hai “Yahi se connection start hoga.”

                         🔧 Backend yeh bol raha hai: "Agar koi /ws pe WebSocket connection maange, toh main allow karta hoon.


👉   .setAllowedOrigins("frontend.com") -- kis origin se request allow krni hai
